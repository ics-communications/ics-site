/* Send off-site links to a new tab.

   These pages are embedded in Google Sites as full-page iframes. That iframe's
   sandbox grants allow-popups but NOT allow-top-navigation, and every Google
   Sites host (icscanada.edu, fics., faculty., perspective.) answers with
   X-Frame-Options: DENY. So inside the embed:

     - a plain link to icscanada.edu tries to load in the iframe, is refused,
       and the visitor gets a blank frame;
     - target="_top" / target="_parent" are silently blocked by the sandbox;
     - target="_blank" is the only navigation that works.

   Opening off-site links in a new tab is also the right behaviour when the
   pages are viewed directly, so this runs unconditionally rather than
   sniffing for the iframe.

   Same-origin links (page to page within this site) are left alone: they
   navigate inside the embed, which is what we want.

   mailto:/tel: are left alone too — the sandbox's allow-popups permits them,
   and forcing _blank would leave stray blank tabs behind.

   Load AFTER js/footer.js so the injected footer links are covered. */
